# LevMyr's Portfolio page

Welcome to the repo of my soon-to-be portfolio page.

## Who am I?

I'm a 21 years old developer who had the opportunity to start up his career in the Software Development world at quite an early age. I'm also the one who wouldn't let this chance slip away, and learn and grow as much as I can.

Who knows? Maybe I'll get to a point where I'll be bigger then Elon Musk... Just joking.

Back to the point, Right now I'm also an employee of a bigger company that creates software for warehouse-, manufacturing process-, and delivery management using .NET Technologies, for now mainly ASP.Net, but also a little bit of WPF/XAML.

## Why I'm starting this project

Of course the project's primary objective is to build my portfolio page - duh -.

But secondarily I want to create this page from the ground up without using any type of frameworks. This will hopefully help me understand and learn much more about the inner workings of front-end development. And it might have the side-effect that people who are like me find this repo and can learn from my achievements / mistakes.
